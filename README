NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::shcompgen::InitOnInstall - Run 'shcompgen init' &
    'shcompgen generate' when distribution is installed

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::shcompgen::InitOnInstall (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-shcompgen-InitOnInstall), released on 2014-12-14.

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

     [shcompgen::InitOnInstall]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin is meant only for building App::shcompgen.

TODO
    Currently runs init() and generate() unconditionally. It's better if we
    only run init() if shell init script doesn't exist or produced by an
    older version.

SEE ALSO
    shcompgen
